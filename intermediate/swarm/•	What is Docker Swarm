Multi-container, multi-machine applications are made possible by joining multiple machines into a “Dockerized” cluster called a swarm.
A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster. After that has happened, we continue to run the Docker commands we’re used to, but now they are executed on a cluster by a swarm manager. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. After joining a swarm, they are referred to as nodes.
Swarm managers can use several strategies to run containers, such as “emptiest node” -- which fills the least utilized machines with containers. Or “global”, which ensures that each machine gets exactly one instance of the specified container. 
Swarm managers are the only machines in a swarm that can execute our commands, or authorize other machines to join the swarm as workers. Workers are just there to provide capacity and do not have the authority to tell any other machine what it can and cannot do.
A swarm is made up of multiple nodes, which can be either physical or virtual machines. The basic concept is simple enough: run docker swarm init to enable swarm mode and make our current machine a swarm manager, then run docker swarm join on other machines to have them join the swarm as workers.
